# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #3
## Subject
_Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve._

## Mandatory Objectives
- [x] Draw few lines of different colors and weights
- [x] Draw a Bezier curve
- [x] Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
- [x] Draw 2 different objects using mouse

## Bonus Objectives

- [x] Draw a custom bitmap image (1 pt) 
- [x] Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects (2 pt)
- [x] Draw a Bezier curve using mouse (1 pt)
- [x] Fill an object with a gradient (1 pt)
- [ ] Delete objects using mouse clicking (2 pt)
- [x] Use mouse as an eraser of:
 - a fixed width (1 pt)
 - a adjustable width (2 pt)
- [x] Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard (2 pt) (using + or -)

## Result
Implemented in C#
* The colored button on the top opens a Color Picker Dialog, where the user can change the pen color
* In the width Combo Box you can change the line and eraser width 
* A've added buttons to select the object what you want to create
* You can create rectangle
 * You can create ellipse
 * you can create more stright lines, after a point
 * I've added a color picker with what you can get the color of every ebject from the screen
 * A combo box for filling mode, figure can be filled, unfilled or with the gradient
 * Clear button used for clearing the screen
 * Save button used for saving your image to a bitmap ;
 * You can zoom in and out by pressing "+" or "-"
#### Total: All mandatory objectives + 10 points (Bonus Objectives)
  
  ## Conclusion
  In this laboratory work, I learned to draw Bezier curves, to write to a bitmap image, to work with GDI primitives and to use Window Forms. Also, I've learned how to do some paint tricks. Working with C# instead of C++ saved me a lot of time and I had fun doing this project. 
  From the begining, I've wanted to do a buttons like in paint, with images, instead of words, but I got some problems with it because the images was rendered in it's original rezolution, and the images wasn's shown.
In the end, I got a "Paint", that can be used to paint images
