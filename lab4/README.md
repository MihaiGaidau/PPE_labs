# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #4
## Subject
_Windows Timer. Animation._

## Bonus Objectives

- [x]  Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel (2 pt) 
- [x]  Solve flickering problem (2 pt) please describe in your readme/report how you did it
- [x]  Add animated objects which interact with each other (2-6 pt), ex.:
    - Few balls which have different velocity and moving angles. In order to get max points, add balls with mouse, make balls to change color on interaction and any other things that will show your engineering spirit
    - Any other interesting and reach in animation application
- [x] Animate a Nyan Cat that leaves a rainbow tail (Math.floor(+35% for task with interacting objects))


## Result
Implemented in C#
* I've created a bouncing balls animation
* You can add balls by click and they all have different speed and size. Also, when they hit the margins they change color. 
* You can add the cat by pressing space and you can move it with arrows (up or down)
* You can speed up or speed down by scrolling the mouse wheel.


  

  ## Conclusion
  In this laboratory work I've learned how to do an animation using timer. Also I've learned how to intereact with each screen and how to move items on every tic. 
In the end I optained a beeautiful anomation with some interesting features.
